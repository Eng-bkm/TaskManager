# MyTasker - Minimalist Task Manager 📝


## Why MyTasker Exists

I created this app for personal use after failing to find a lightweight, non-complex task manager. As a good friend wisely observed:

> "Most task management tools miss the core purpose - they end up wasting your time instead of saving it."

MyTasker cuts through the clutter:
- Insert tasks in seconds
- Mark importance with one tap
- Edit details later *only if needed*
- Get intelligent notifications
